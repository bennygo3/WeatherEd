# **Where To Weather**

### Weather App

The project was to create a weather app using OpenWeather APIs to give users real time weather data after searching for any city or location in the world.
Building this project was useful in my learning of how to setup features in a website using API calls.
Using API calls and databases saves an insane amount of time, research and coding for developing an application such as this one.

The curation of what to add, layout and look is always a challenge when developing a new application or website. 
Below are listed requirements for the application and associated pictures: 

##### A weather dashboard with form inputs:

WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history:

WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index:

WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe:

WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity:

WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city..


###Future development:
I plan on altering layout for multiple viewports and add a clear history button to get rid of recent searches.
